Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Essentially, responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size on which it is viewed. It keeps images from being larger than the screen width, and prevents visitors on mobile devices from needing to do extra work to read your content.
